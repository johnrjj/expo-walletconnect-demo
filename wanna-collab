Hey John, saw you forked this project.

Want to collab on any of this stuff?

I'm Expo's 1st user, have been building/using RN since before it was public, been building https://draftbit.com last couple of years and now I'm dedicating time to making mobile (Expo/RN) a better web3 experience

I'm going to be working with folks from Expo, RN and others in the community to make this happen

If you're interested shoot me a DM https://twitter.com/peterpme

Otherwise thanks!
